# Maryland-Crash-Data-Resources Package

**Created by Jakub**

This package is designed for exploring and analyzing road accident data from Maryland. It provides a comprehensive workflow to load, preprocess, aggregate, and cluster accident data, along with a predictive model using XGBoost. The main function of the package is `execute_workflow()`, which wraps the entire process of data processing and model execution.

## Features:
- **Data Loading**: Automatically loads Maryland crash datasets.
- **Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, data transformations, and feature engineering.
- **Aggregation**: Aggregates data at various levels for analysis.
- **Clustering**: Performs clustering on accident data to identify patterns.
- **XGBoost Model**: Builds a predictive model to assess accident severity and identify key factors influencing accidents.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualization tools to explore data and detect patterns in road accidents.

In the `dashboard.jpg` file, you can find a Power BI dashboard built using the three main datasets, which visualizes key insights from the analysis.
